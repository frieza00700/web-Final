        <h2>About Me and Academic Honesty</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Iran. It's full of diversity and has so many historical places, 
            nature, and culture. Approximately three years ago I moved to Canada. Having the opportunity 
            to live in North America was my dream.  I come from a small family, I have one brother, 
            he is 3 years younger than me. We are like friends and always support each other. 
            My mother was a teacher and left home early when I was two years old, 
            so I had to go to kindergarten. In fact, I grew up in the kindergarten 
            and I believe that kindergarten teaches social skills to children. 
            Since I was five years old, I have been swimming regularly. 
            Swimming is my favorite sport and my favorite hobby. When I 
            was 5 years old, I began swimming training and this training 
            lasted for 15 years. My performance in the competition was not 
            good at the beginning, but in the end, I was able to win two of the races. 
            I learned the value of effort and friendly competition through racing. 
            Eventually, I became a swimming instructor after continuous efforts. 
            I studied IT engineering in my country.  I studied in the Zanjan university. 
            It is one of the best private universities in our country. After graduation, 
            I worked in a company where I gained too much experience. 
            The first was an ISP company, and the second was a hardware company. 
            I believe that life has too many experiences that make it beautiful. 
            Although my life isn't filled with good things. 
            I was informed one year ago that my father was suffering from cancer. 
            He sold everything to pay for treatment. because the treatments in my 
            country are too expensive. I have to work , but I hope 
            that he will recover and we can return to our previous lives.
            I declare that my assignment is whole my own work in accordance with Seneca Academic Policy. No part of this assignment has been copied
            manually or electronically from other source(including web sites) except for the information provided by the instructors and / or made<br>
